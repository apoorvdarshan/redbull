# 🥫 Red Bull-Themed Landing Page

A creatively reimagined landing page inspired by the official Red Bull website, built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. While it's not a clone, the layout pays homage to the original design—with my own custom visuals, easter eggs, and animations to give it a fun, personalized twist.
